  <br><p style="color:white"> The Avengers is a team of extraordinary individuals, with either superpowers or other special characteristics. Its purpose was to protect<br> global stability from inner or extraterrestrial threats. Though primarily affiliated with the United States of America, they worked with the<br> peaceful interests of the whole world in mind rather than a specific country or organization. The Avengers were first assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D.<br> when Loki invaded Earth with his Chitauri army to conquer the planet. The team, consisting of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow,<br> Hawkeye and Hulk, defeated Loki and went their separate ways for a while.<br>  </p>
          
<br> <p style="color:white">Under Captain America's leadership, the team completed several operations around the world with success, until the amount of collateral<br> damage during their conflicts caused the United Nations to pass the Sokovia Accords in an attempt to regulate their actions, turning the team<br> from a private organization to one which was under the control of the government. The differences in opinions created a rift within the team<br> which split the Avengers into two factions, one led by Iron Man and the other by Captain America. After Captain America was able to stop<br> Helmut Zemo, the instigator of their fight, the team was divided; Iron Man, Vision and War Machine remained official members, while a small <br> group consisting of Captain America, Black Widow, and Falcon continued to operate in the shadows. Stark would try to boost the Avengers'<br> membership by inviting Spider-Man to join, but the young hero turned down the offer to remain closer to the people he had sworn to protect. </p>
